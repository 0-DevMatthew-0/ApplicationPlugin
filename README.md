This is my developer application for leet. This is my first fully finished plugin and I really hope it works. I've been trying to test it but haven't been able to. It may not work. After a thorough examination, based what I've learned so far about php and pocketmine plugin creation I believe it has a high chance of working. This is a simple plugin with a few commands. /teleport, /heal, /diceroll, /whyiamapplying, /information, /experience, /servversion, /promote, /main and more to come if need be. I'd really love some feedback.
